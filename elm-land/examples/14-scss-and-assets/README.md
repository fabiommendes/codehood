> Built with [Elm Land](https://elm.land) ðŸŒˆ

## Local development

```bash
# Requires Node.js v18+ (https://nodejs.org)
npm start
```

Normally, you can run Elm Land apps with `elm-land server`, but this example
uses `sass` to compile your SCSS files to CSS as you code.

For that reason, we'll be running a script in our `package.json` file.


## Deploying to production

Elm Land projects are most commonly deployed as static websites. 

Please visit [the "Deployment" guide](https://elm.land/guide/deploying) to learn more
about deploying your app for free using Netlify or Vercel.
