Codehood-CLI
============

A simple command line tool to interact with the Codehood server.


Installation
------------

If you have pip in your machine, just

    pip install codehood-cli

It is possible (and even recommended) to use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) instead
to run it in an isolated environment. Install uv and then run 

    uvx codeschool-cli --help

The tool is also packaged using PyInstaller and can be run from an self-executing
binary.
