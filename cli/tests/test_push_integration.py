"""
End-to-end test for `codehood push` against a real dev server. See
`dev/specs/to-do/push.md`'s "Proof" section: init a course, push it,
resources visible; delete a local file, push again, resource gone.
MD/CODE only -- FILE is planned but not executed this slice.

Skipped by default, same as `tests/test_api_integration.py`: run with
`--run-integration` and a server answering at `CODEHOOD_SERVER`.

**This test mutates the shared dev server's `cs101`/`ada_2026-1` course.**
That course ships pre-seeded demo resources (`sicp-ch1`, `toolchain`,
`syllabus`, `factorial` -- verified against the running dev server while
writing this test). Push's default pruning behavior means the first push
this test makes deletes every one of them, since a freshly-scaffolded
local repository's `resources/` starts empty of them. There is no admin
endpoint available to this suite to create a disposable discipline/edition
to push against instead (`ROADBLOCKS.md` candidate), and `ada`/`2026-1` is
the exact course the spec's own "Proof" section names. Gated behind
`CODEHOOD_RUN_DESTRUCTIVE_PUSH_TEST=1` on top of `--run-integration` so
opting into the destructive suite is a separate, deliberate choice from
opting into integration tests in general -- flagged to the orchestrator,
not decided unilaterally here.
