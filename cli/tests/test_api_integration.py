"""
Integration tests: real HTTP calls to a running Codehood server, not a
`MockTransport`. `tests/test_api_generated.py` proves the generated client
matches the *committed* spec; this file proves it still matches *reality*.

Skipped by default -- run with `task test-integration`, or
`pytest --run-integration -m integration`. Targets `CODEHOOD_SERVER`
(default `http://localhost:4321`), and skips at runtime if nothing answers
there rather than failing with a wall of connection errors.

See `dev/specs/to-do/api.md`, "Proving it works".
