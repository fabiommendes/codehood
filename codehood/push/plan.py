"""
The pure core of `codehood push`: a generator that diffs a repository
against the server's current state and yields a plan.

No client, no ids, no `run()` -- see `dev/specs/to-do/push.md`,
"Architecture". `run.py` is the only thing in `codehood/push/` that
executes a `PushOp`.

The two inputs are whole values, `LocalState` and `ServerState`, rather
than a dozen loose mappings: `slug -> ref` and `slug -> version` are the
same type and mean different things, and naming them as fields is what
stops a caller from swapping them silently.
